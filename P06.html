         <h1>Biography</h1>
         <p><b>Ellen Swallow Richards</b> was an industrial 
            engineer and environmental chemist. Ellen's work in 
            pioneering foor sanitary engineering laid
            a foundation for the new science of 
            economics. Ellen founded the home of 
            economics movement and she was the first 
            woman to apply chemistry to the study of 
            nutrition. She graduated from the 
            Massachusetts Institute of technology
            in 1873 to then later become it's first 
            female instructor. Ellen was homeschooled in
            her early years, but when her family moved to 
            Westford in 1859, she attended Westford academy. 
            She studied mathematics, composition, and Latin.

         <p> Ellen was the first woman ever in America to be 
            accepted to any school of science and technology.
            She was also the first American woman to 
            ever get a degree in chemistry. She got 
            this degree from Vassar College in 1870.
            Ellen was known as a feminist and she 
            believed that women's work in a household
            was an essential aspect of the economy. 
            On June 4, 1875, Ellen Swallow married Robert H. Richards,a 
            chairman of the Mine Engineering Department at MIT, she 
            had worked with him in the mineralogy laboratory. They lived  
            in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. With her husband's support, Ellen 
            remained associated with MIT, volunteering her services and giving
            $1,000 annually to the "Woman's Laboratory," which was a program in 
            which her students were mostly schoolteachers, whose training had 
            lacked laboratory work, and who wanted to perform chemical experiments 
            learn mineralogy.
